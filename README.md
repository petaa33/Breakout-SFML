# Breakout game made with C++ and SFML
## This project is a 2D Breakout-style game built in C++ with SFML, featuring Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) collision detection between entities. Beyond the classic gameplay, it includes mechanics such as multi-hit blocks, power-up/penalty drops (e.g., speed modifiers, paddle size adjustments), and block behaviors which increase challenge and add variety.
